# Excell_spliter
Takes a Excel file and splits it by custom needs

Project I made for financial department that had a yearly routine of employs data update where next steps were done manually:
More than 6000 employees had their managers and directors receiving Excel files - must be in very specific format of table and decoration (600 files totally)
Updating a curtain data that involves this employee (the rest of the data had to be locked) - must include all the notes and sub.data
Returning new version to the director/manager specific repository.

UPDATE : the project is still ongoing and future to be implemented in the internal system so the process will run automatically
